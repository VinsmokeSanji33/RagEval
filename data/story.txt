Once upon a time in a small village nestled between towering mountains, there was a young girl named Mira. She lived with her grandmother in a cozy cottage surrounded by colorful flowers and tall, whispering trees. Every day, Mira would run through the meadows, chasing butterflies and listening to the songs of birds.

One day, as Mira wandered deep into the forest, she found a glowing stone hidden beneath an ancient oak tree. Intrigued, she picked it up and felt a warm, comforting energy fill her. The stone shimmered brightly, and a voice spoke from within the stone.

"Only those with a pure heart can unlock its power," the voice said.

Mira, curious but not afraid, whispered, "What power do you hold?"

The stone responded, "I can grant a single wish. But choose wisely."

Mira thought for a moment. She could wish for riches or fame, but instead, she thought of her grandmother, who was growing older. "I wish for good health and happiness for my grandmother," she said softly.

The stone glowed even brighter, and as the days passed, her grandmother grew stronger, more joyful, and lived many more years in good health. Mira knew that her wish had been granted, not because of magic, but because of her selflessness and love.

And so, Mira lived happily ever after, knowing that sometimes, the simplest wishes hold the greatest magic.
